# pre-commit-with-lint 

[[中文文档]](./READMECN.md)

## introduction

This repository forked from pre-commit. It will run scripts in the package.json which is specified in the config as same as pre-commit.

And there is a new feature. It can add some lint and use lint to examine only **the changed file** in current commit, instead of examine the whole file of the project. It obviously will save some time in the commit.

## how to use?

Just install this package.

```
  npm install pre-commit-with-lint --save-dev
```

This package will use stylelint for ".(s?css)|(less)$" file and eslint for ".jsx?$" file as default, so you need to install the stylelint, eslint, or someone which you want to use.

The default config is as follows:

```
{
  "pre-commit": {
    "lint": {
      "stylelint": ".(s?css)|(less)$",
      "eslint": ".jsx?$"
    }
  }
}
```

You can add other linter freely.

```
{
  "pre-commit": {
    "lint": {
      "tslint": ".ts$"
    }
  }
}
```

You can disable lint by set "false".


```
{
  "pre-commit": {
    "lint": "false"   //disable all linter
  }
}

{
  "pre-commit": {
    "lint": {
      "eslint": "false"   //disable one linter
    }
  }
}
```

If some linter are set in the package.json of project without install, there will throw a error in the console and prevent the commit. So you can set the linter in the package.json and remind the other member in the project to install by this error.

And don't worry, if there is no config and default linter, there only throw the warning.

If you don't need run scripts, you can set the empty array like this:

```
{
  "pre-commit": {
    "run": []   //disable default run test
  }
}
```

**pre-commit** is a pre-commit hook installer for `git`. It will ensure that
your `npm test` (or other specified scripts) passes before you can commit your
changes. This all conveniently configured in your `package.json`.

But don't worry, you can still force a commit by telling `git` to skip the
`pre-commit` hooks by simply committing using `--no-verify`.

### Installation

It's advised to install the **pre-commit** module as a `devDependencies` in your
`package.json` as you only need this for development purposes. To install the
module simply run:

```
npm install --save-dev pre-commit
```

To install it as `devDependency`. When this module is installed it will override
the existing `pre-commit` file in your `.git/hooks` folder. Existing
`pre-commit` hooks will be backed up as `pre-commit.old` in the same repository.

### Configuration

`pre-commit` will try to run your `npm test` command in the root of the git
repository by default unless it's the default value that is set by the `npm
init` script. 

But `pre-commit` is not limited to just running your `npm test`'s during the
commit hook. It's also capable of running every other script that you've
specified in your `package.json` "scripts" field. So before people commit you
could ensure that:

- You have 100% coverage
- All styling passes.
- JSHint passes.
- Contribution licenses signed etc.

The only thing you need to do is add a `pre-commit` array to your `package.json`
that specifies which scripts you want to have ran and in which order:

```js
{
  "name": "437464d0899504fb6b7b",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "ERROR: No README.md file found!",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: I SHOULD FAIL LOLOLOLOLOL \" && exit 1",
    "foo": "echo \"fooo\" && exit 0",
    "bar": "echo \"bar\" && exit 0"
  },
  "pre-commit": [
    "foo",
    "bar",
    "test"
  ]
}
```

In the example above, it will first run: `npm run foo` then `npm run bar` and
finally `npm run test` which will make the commit fail as it returns the error
code `1`.  If you prefer strings over arrays or `precommit` without a middle
dash, that also works:

```js
{
  "precommit": "foo, bar, test"
  "pre-commit": "foo, bar, test"
  "pre-commit": ["foo", "bar", "test"]
  "precommit": ["foo", "bar", "test"],
  "precommit": {
    "run": "foo, bar, test",
  },
  "pre-commit": {
    "run": ["foo", "bar", "test"],
  },
  "precommit": {
    "run": ["foo", "bar", "test"],
  },
  "pre-commit": {
    "run": "foo, bar, test",
  }
}
```

The examples above are all the same. In addition to configuring which scripts
should be ran you can also configure the following options:

- **silent** Don't output the prefixed `pre-commit:` messages when things fail
  or when we have nothing to run. Should be a boolean.
- **colors** Don't output colors when we write messages. Should be a boolean.
- **template** Path to a file who's content should be used as template for the
  git commit body.

These options can either be added in the `pre-commit`/`precommit` object as keys
or as `"pre-commit.{key}` key properties in the `package.json`:

```js
{
  "precommit.silent": true,
  "pre-commit": {
    "silent": true
  }
}
```

It's all the same. Different styles so use what matches your project. To learn
more about the scripts, please read the official `npm` documentation:
